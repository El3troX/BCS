Bus Credit System for Hack Battle 

PROBLEM: Based on our observations and feedback from other students on campus, we have found that the shuttle service is highly inefficient due to its current transaction method. During peak times, such as rush hours, class times, or lab sessions, it takes significantly longer than expected to complete transactions.

SOLUTION: After dealing with this issue for over a year, we have developed a solution that will streamline transactions, making them more efficient and convenient by using students' ID cards. Our proposed method allows the transaction amount to be directly debited from an online wallet in the form of credits. When users add funds to their wallet, the money is converted to credits, which can then be used for transactions. On the back end, we will settle the amount equivalent to the debited credits from the students' wallets with the respective logistics provider. This system will also encourage students to carry their ID cards at all times.
